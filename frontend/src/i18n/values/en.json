It allows you to know the approximate final average. It is calculated in a way selected by the user in the application settings. It is recommended that you choose the appropriate option. This is because the calculation of school averages differs. Additionally, if your school reports the average of the subjects on the Vulcan page, the application downloads them and does not calculate these averages. This can be changed by forcing the calculation of the average in the application settings.\n\n<b>Average of grades only from selected semester</b>:\n1.
